# Project Context

## Overview
This project is a web application designed to convert Figma designs into production-ready HTML and CSS code using a combination of traditional web technologies and advanced machine/deep learning techniques. The goal is to bridge the gap between design and development, enabling users to generate code from design files quickly and efficiently.

## Key Features

- **Figma Integration:**  
  Users can provide a Figma file link or upload design images. The system fetches design data using the Figma API and prepares it for processing.

- **Machine/Deep Learning Pipeline:**  
  The core of the application utilizes machine learning to analyze design images and generate corresponding HTML/CSS code. This involves:
  - **Image Analysis:**  
    Using computer vision techniques (e.g., CNNs, Vision Transformers) to extract visual features from design images.
  - **Sequence Generation:**  
    An encoder-decoder architecture (similar to pix2code) that translates visual features into a sequence of code tokens representing HTML and CSS.

- **User Interface & Experience:**  
  A modern, responsive, and aesthetically pleasing UI with:
  - A landing page that details the tool’s features.
  - An interactive dashboard that allows users to log in, submit designs, view progress, and access generated code.
  - Real-time feedback during the ML processing (using WebSockets or polling).

- **Backend Services:**  
  Integration with services for:
  - **Authentication & Database:**  
    Using Supabase for user management, session handling, and data storage.
  - **Asset Storage:**  
    Managing temporary files, uploaded images, and generated code.
  - **Asynchronous Task Processing:**  
    Handling long-running ML inference tasks with job queues and background processing.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Data Collection and Training:**  
  Collecting a robust dataset of design-to-code pairs is essential for training an accurate ML model.
  
- **Model Complexity:**  
  Balancing the complexity of the model (encoder-decoder with attention) with performance constraints during inference.
  
- **Integration with Figma:**  
  Securely and reliably integrating with Figma’s API to fetch design data and handling potential rate limits or API changes.
  
- **Error Handling & Post-Processing:**  
  Ensuring generated code is syntactically correct and user-friendly through post-processing and validation techniques.

## Technological Ecosystem
- **Frontend:** Next.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Next.js API routes, Supabase
- **Machine Learning:** TensorFlow/PyTorch, CNNs/Transformers, attention mechanisms
