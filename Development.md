# Development Plan

## 1. Project Architecture & Stack

### **Frontend**
- **Framework:** Next.js
  - Utilize Next.js for both SSR (Server-Side Rendering) and API routes.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
  - Rapid development with utility-first CSS.
- **UI Components:**  
  - Consider integrating Headless UI or Radix UI for accessible, interactive components.
- **State Management & Data Fetching:**  
  - Use SWR or React Query for efficient data fetching and real-time updates.

### **Backend & Database**
- **Authentication & Database:** Supabase
  - Manage user sessions, authentication, and store user data.
- **File & Asset Storage:**  
  - Supabase Storage or AWS S3 for handling file uploads and storing generated code files.
- **API Routes:**  
  - Next.js API routes for handling requests (e.g., Figma integration, ML inference requests).

### **Machine/Deep Learning Infrastructure**
- **Model Architecture:**
  - **Encoder:** Convolutional Neural Network (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet) or Vision Transformer for image feature extraction.
  - **Decoder:** Sequence generation model using LSTM/GRU or Transformer architecture.
  - **Attention Mechanism:** To align image features with code token generation.
- **Frameworks:**
  - TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch for model development.
- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - OpenCV for image manipulation and augmentation.
  - Preprocessing pipelines to resize, normalize, and augment images.
- **Training & Inference:**
  - Train on a dataset of design images and their corresponding HTML/CSS code (inspired by pix2code).
  - Consider a microservice architecture for the ML model to allow scalable inference (using FastAPI or Flask).

### **Integration with Figma**
- **Figma API:**
  - Secure integration to fetch design data.
  - Process the Figma JSON data and extract visual components for further ML processing.
- **Data Transformation:**
  - Convert Figma design elements into a format usable by the ML pipeline.

## 2. Workflow & Process

### **Development Phases**
1. **Prototype & MVP:**
   - Develop a minimal working version that accepts a design image or Figma link, performs basic ML inference, and returns generated code.
   - Focus on core functionalities: Figma integration, basic ML model, and frontend UI.

2. **Model Enhancement:**
   - Improve the ML model with advanced techniques (attention, beam search decoding).
   - Collect more training data or utilize data augmentation to boost model performance.
   - Implement post-processing routines to ensure code validity.

3. **UI/UX Improvements:**
   - Refine the landing page and dashboard.
   - Integrate interactive code viewers (e.g., Monaco Editor) for reviewing generated code.
   - Add real-time processing updates using WebSockets or long polling.

4. **Scaling & Optimization:**
   - Containerize ML services with Docker for scalability.
   - Integrate job queues (e.g., BullMQ, RabbitMQ) for background processing.
   - Set up CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.
   - Deploy the frontend on platforms like Vercel or Netlify, and backend services on cloud providers with GPU support if necessary.

### **Error Handling & Monitoring**
- **Logging:**  
  - Centralized logging (e.g., Datadog, Loggly) for both frontend and backend.
- **Error Tracking:**  
  - Use Sentry or a similar tool for real-time error monitoring.
- **Performance Monitoring:**  
  - Monitor ML inference times and overall API performance.

## 3. Deployment & CI/CD
- **Containerization:**  
  - Use Docker to containerize the ML microservice.
- **Orchestration:**  
  - Use Kubernetes (if necessary) for orchestrating multiple services.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:**  
  - Set up pipelines using GitHub Actions or GitLab CI for testing, building, and deploying both the frontend and ML services.
- **Deployment Platforms:**  
  - **Frontend:** Deploy on Vercel/Netlify.
  - **Backend/ML Services:** Deploy on cloud providers with necessary GPU support (AWS, GCP, or Azure).

## 4. Security & Compliance
- **Authentication & Authorization:**  
  - Rely on Supabase for secure user management.
  - Implement CORS, rate limiting, and secure API endpoints.
- **Data Privacy:**  
  - Ensure secure transmission and storage of user data and design files.
- **Regular Audits:**  
  - Conduct periodic security reviews and audits to maintain compliance with industry standards.

## 5. Additional Tools & Libraries
- **Code Editors & UI Components:**  
  - Monaco Editor for in-app code viewing and editing.
- **API Documentation:**  
  - Swagger or Postman for documenting and testing APIs.
- **Monitoring & Analytics:**  
  - Integrate analytics to track user behavior and performance metrics.
